# SPCAN (Self-Paced CAN)

Self-Paced Collaborative and Adversarial Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (T-PAMI)
1. Object Recognition (image)
2. Action Recognition (video)

Paper Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8943120

Codes are tested with pytorch 0.2/0.3 and python2.7.

The code of the Object Recognition task is based on our CVPR18 paper Collaborative and Adversarial Network ([CAN](https://github.com/zhangweichen2006/iCAN)).
The code of the Action Recongition task is based on Yuanjun Xiong's Temporal Segment Network ([TSN](https://github.com/yjxiong/tsn-pytorch)).
