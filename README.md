# SPCAN (Self-Paced CAN)

Self-Paced Collaborative and Adversarial Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (T-PAMI)
1. Object Recognition (image)
2. Action Recognition (video)

Codes are tested with pytorch 0.2/0.3 and python2.7.

The code of the Object Recognition task is based on the our CVPR18 paper Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN)[https://github.com/zhangweichen2006/iCAN].
The code of the Action Recongition task is based on Yuanjun Xiong's Temporal Segment Network (TSN)[https://github.com/yjxiong/tsn-pytorch].
